# Introduction

Blockchain technology arose to fulfil the promise of genesis and exchange of digital
native value in a disintermediated, censorship resistant, safe and scalable way.

Billions of people on the Earth (and maybe the Moon or Mars) would have the possibility
of transacting without borders, barriers or discrimination within a distributed
computational infrastructure that cancels out the need of trusted parties in between.

As well as exchange of _digital information_ in the Internet era relies on _Communication
Protocols_, the exchange of _digital value_ relies on _Consensus Protocols_. Combining
distributed computation, cryptography and game theory into a mathematical equilibrium
_Consensus Protocols_ are the engines that power blockchains, keeping the history
of digital value unique, consistent, trustless, and tamper-proof within a distributed
public ledger.

Blockchains' performances depend on their Consensus Protocols. At the beginning
of this technological journey the so-called _Proof of Work_ (PoW) consensus powered
the first generation of Blockchains, with the merit of showing the existence of
digital native value but at the same time facing the limitation of their own foundation.

In fact, running an interplanetary computational battle one against the other,
just for the sake of validating the next block of data, takes a lot of time and
enormous amount of energy. As "Proof of Work" suggests itself, showing off a commitment
in the system, through the allocation of computational and energetic resources,
is the core of this consensus mechanism.

However, Blockchains that run on PoW fail in fulfilling the promise of scalability,
decentralisation, transaction speed, and costs, ending up relying on energey-intensive
centralised computational farms.

The ultimate output of a Blockchain infrastrucuture is: reaching consensus to finalize
_state transitions_ of a distributed permissionless system in secure, scalable,
and decentralized way.

The history of engineering teaches us that _any_ technology evolves towards higher
efficiency and scalability: who obtains the _same_ useful output consuming less
input resources and time survives.

Is PoW the only way to reach consensus and finalize a state transition of a distributed
permissionless system in a secure way?

Is the foundational Blockchain promise doomed by the Buterin trilemma?

**Here is where Algorand steps in.**

# Scalability

---

Scalability can be quantified in serveral ways:

- Block's finalization latency;
- Transactions per second;
- Transactions cost;
- Network power consumption;
- Node hardware requirements.

Algorand PPoS brings the number of finalized transactions per second from few
dozen achieved by PoW up to 10k and shrinks transactions' finalization time
form PoW’s dozen of minutes (or a few hours) to just 3.5 seconds, with no waste
of energy, neglectable transaction’s cost (0.001 ALGO), and no hardware
barriers.

So we have quantitative evidences of Algorand's _scalability_.

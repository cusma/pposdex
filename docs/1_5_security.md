# Security

---

Quantify security is not that simple (and out of the scope of this project).

PPoS is secure as soon as a supermajority of the stake is in non-malicious
hands.

PPoS is provenly fork-less, ensuring blocks' instant finality.

Block proposer election and block validation remain secrets until accomplished,
preventing malicious users to DDoS, corrupt or threat honest nodes.

Moreover, Algorand [State Proofs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/stateproofs/)
secure Algorand's history with post-quantum resistant [Falcon signatures](https://falcon-sign.info/).

A quantitative attestation of Algorand's security is represented by the fact
that, at the time of writing (Sep 2023), Algorand never experienced a downtime
nor a reorg since the genesis block (June 2019).
